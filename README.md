Building a Music Themed Website
- I made a html and css file and linked the 2 together
- I found a font on google fonts and copied the html and css code and pasted them in each respected file
- I started with formatting the nav bar, I made a div to be able to style it and everything inside and then i made another div for the main title of the nav bar.
- I styled the li in the nav bar to be alighed with the right side of the screen, I used hover to add a gray background to each link for whenever the user hovers over it. When styling each link (a) i made sure there was no text decoration to mess up the styling and used dislpay: block to push the text a lil further down in the nav bar

- I had a lil bit of touble styling my header but after i made my margin and padding 0 it was centered where I wanted it.

- I made 5 cards for the main music portion and added an image to each. I had a very hard time getting the cards side by side and I couldnt figure why my text wasnt showing up on the Website. The fixes i used for these were: I used float:inherit to get the images beside each other then spaced it out with a margin. The fix for why my text wasnt showing up was that I didnt realize that I was using overflow hidden which causes any element that spills outside the parent elements to no longer appear.
- I also addead a gray image to each card to make it look more like our reference. I did this by styling my card content with a background image
- When doing my audio bars and the text beside each bar I made 4 audio sections and 4 flex boxes. All I did for the audio bars were center them, then since I put them in a ul I messed with the margin and padding until the space between each one was correct.
-  I had one last card to style and i simply centered it.
